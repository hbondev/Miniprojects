"Hi everyone,

Welcome to my inaugural project on GitHub. In this mini-project, I've developed a static project named 'SimpleTimer,' allowing users to start, reset, and pause the timer using buttons.

I wrote this code purely for enjoyment, aiming to enhance my coding skills and familiarize myself with working with intervals.

Project Name: 'SimpleTimer'
Technologies Used:
Vanilla JavaScript
CSS
HTML"
